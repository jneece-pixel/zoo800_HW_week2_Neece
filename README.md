3. When I tried to recreate the figures, I found that the code included local paths that were not able to be run on my computer, and that referenced folders not present in the repo. The files in the repo were not ordered, but some .R files could not be fun before executing entire R scripts saved in a different file. Overall, I tried for about 45 minutes to run the code to produce their Forest Types Maps, but was never able to recreate the figure.
